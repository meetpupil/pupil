   <h2>Terms of Service</h2>
   <p>DevPupil's mission is to give underrepresented minority students the opportunity to learn computer science.</p>
   <p>Please read these Terms of Service (“Terms”) carefully before accessing or using the Services. Accessing or using any part of the Services or clicking on an “I Agree” or “Sign Up” button that may be made available to you means that you agree to be bound by these Terms without modification.</p>
   <p>These Terms are a legal contract between you and DevPupil regarding your use of the Services. You may use the Services only if you can form a binding contract with DevPupil and are not a person barred from receiving the Services under the laws of the United States or other applicable jurisdiction. If you are accepting these Terms and using the Services on behalf of a company, organization, government, or other legal entity, you represent and warrant that you are authorized to do so. You may use the Services only in compliance with these Terms and all applicable local, state, national, and international laws, rules and regulations.</p>
   <p>These Terms are subject to change. You are agreeing to be bound by such changes if you continue to use to the Services after these Terms change, so please check these Terms for changes periodically.</p>

   <br>

   <h4>Additional Terms</h4>
   <p>Some Services may be subject to additional posted guidelines, rules or terms of service (“Additional Terms”) and your use of such Services will be conditioned on your agreement to the Additional Terms. If there is any conflict between these Terms and the Additional Terms, the Additional Terms will control for that Service, unless the Additional Terms expressly state that these Terms will control.</p>

   <br>

   <h4>Children Under Age 13</h4>
   <p>We take steps to minimize the collection of personal data from Users under the age of 13 as explained in the DevPupil privacy policy. If you are under the age of 13, we encourage you to get the approval of a parent or legal guardian before creating an account on DevPupil. DevPupil allows certain representatives of school districts and schools, such as teachers, administrators, counselors, mentors, and other educators (a “Educator”) to connect with students through the Services in order to provide tutorial, educational and similar services. If you are an Educator, you may register accounts on the Services for one or more of your students.</p>

   <p>If you are an Educator and you register an account for a student who is under the age of 13 (a “Child”), you represent and warrant that you or the educational organization you work for has proper permission to register the Child for DevPupil, and that you have obtained the necessary parental consent for DevPupil’s collection of the Child’s personal information for the use and benefit of the school and for no other commercial purpose. In addition, you agree to be bound by these Terms on behalf of the educational organization you work for.</p>


   <br>

   <h4>Your Account</h4>
   <p>If you create an account for Services, you are responsible for the security of your account and for keeping your own password safe. If you are using an account assigned to you by an Educator, your Educator may be able to access and disable your account.</p>
   <p>DevPupil may permit you to register an account for the Services through certain third party social networking services, such as Facebook Connect and Google (“Authentication Service”). By registering for the Services using an Authentication Service, you agree that DevPupil may access your account information from the Authentication Service and you agree to any and all terms of use of the Authentication Service regarding your use of the Services via the Authentication Service. You are solely responsible for your interactions with the Authentication Service.</p>

   <br>

   <h4>Privacy</h4>
   <p>Your privacy is important to us. DevPupil’s Privacy Policy explains how we treat your personal data and is incorporated into these Terms by reference. Please read the Privacy Policy carefully for information relating to DevPupil’s collection, use, and disclosure of your personal information.</p>
   <p>If you are a student that uses an account registered for you by a Educator or otherwise connected to an Educator, you agree that DevPupil may disclose your information to the Educators associated with your account. If you are an Educator, you agree not to share student information you receive from DevPupil with anybody other than authorized agents of the classroom, school district, or other educational establishment you represent. DevPupil does not use student data for any targeted or behavioral advertising, profiling, or onward disclosure.</p>
